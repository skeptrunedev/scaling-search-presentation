- Optimizing vector inference
- Scaling ingest
- Sharding your search index

# Latency by layer

1. Inference vectors for query ~15ms
2. Typo detection+correction ~1ms
3. Score docs in search index ~10ms
4. Re-rank (LTR/cross-encode) ~15ms
5. First LLM token (TTFT) ~250ms

# Fast Typo Correction

- Many vector db's don't correct typos
    - Harder when multi-tenant
- BK-Tree vs. SymSpell Data Structures
    - [SymSpell is 100x faster](https://seekstorm.com/blog/symspell-vs-bk-tree/)

# PSA: Vector/Re-ranker Latency

- Cloud API's take ~150ms, but 15ms possible w/ Candle
- Ingesting 1,000,000 chunks (33k batches)
    - ~80mins using OpenAI
    - ~8mins on Candle
- LTR plugins usually <10ms

# Scaling Ingest

- You almost certainly need a queue+worker architecture
- Using a worker for updates and deletions enables chunking experiments at scale
- Consider an id system which allows you to upsert easily

# Sharding your search index Pt. 1

## TLDR: think about it

### What is a shard?

- A shard is an instance of the search lib (Lucene, FAISS, etc.)
- Shards are made up of segments
- Segments are indices (IDF or HNSW)
- Small segments should be merged off-peak hours

---

# Sharding your search index Pt. 2

### How to optimize?

- Usually best to think about sharding before HNSW params
- Always have `shards > 2*nodes` such that you can horizontally scale CPU if needed
- Replicate shards for more read throughput
- Different db's map their thread pools to shards differently and you should work with your vendor to address it
